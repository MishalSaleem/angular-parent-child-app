# ðŸš€ Angular Parent-Child Communication Demo

A simple Angular application demonstrating **@Input** and **@Output** decorators for component communication.

## ðŸ“‹ Features

- âœ… **Parent Component** with input field and send button
- âœ… **Child Component** that receives data via `@Input`
- âœ… **Event emission** from child to parent via `@Output`
- âœ… **Real-time communication** between components
- âœ… **Modern Angular 20** with standalone components
- âœ… **TypeScript** with proper type definitions
- âœ… **Responsive UI** with gradient background

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works

1. **Parent â†’ Child**: User types a name and clicks "Send Name to Child"
2. **@Input**: Child component receives the name property
3. **Child displays**: "Received name: [NAME]"
4. **@Output**: Child emits greeting event back to parent
5. **Parent displays**: Greeting message from child

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- Angular CLI installed globally

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/angular-parent-child-app.git
   cd angular-parent-child-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server:**

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
